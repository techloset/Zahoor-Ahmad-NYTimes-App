# Project Branches Overview

## 1. `master` Branch

The `master` branch is the primary branch representing the stable and production-ready version of the New York Times API website project. Commits in this branch are thoroughly tested and validated before deployment. It serves as the baseline for creating new features or fixing bugs in separate branches.

## 2. `notmaster` Branch
