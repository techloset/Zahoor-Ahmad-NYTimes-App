# Project Branches Overview

## 1. `master` Branch

The `master` branch is the primary branch representing the stable and production-ready version of the New York Times API website project. Commits in this branch are thoroughly tested and validated before deployment. It serves as the baseline for creating new features or fixing bugs in separate branches.

## 2. `api` Branch

The `api` branch is dedicated to working with API-related changes for the New York Times website project. Developers use this branch to implement, test, and integrate features or enhancements related specifically to the application's interactions with the New York Times API. Once changes in this branch are tested and validated, they can be merged into the `master` branch for production.

## 3. `styles` Branch

The `styles` branch focuses on handling style-related changes within the New York Times API website project. This includes modifications to the user interface (UI), CSS, and other presentational aspects. By isolating style changes in this branch, developers can work collaboratively on the project's aesthetics without affecting the logic or functionality. Once the styling updates are completed and tested, changes from this branch can be merged into the `master` branch for a unified and visually polished application.

## 4. `redux` Branch

The `redux` branch is created to manage state management using Redux in the New York Times API website project. This branch is specifically dedicated to implementing and testing Redux-related changes. It allows developers to handle complex state logic in a centralized manner, enhancing the scalability and maintainability of the application. Once the Redux implementation is complete and tested, changes from this branch can be merged into the `master` branch.

**Note:** Regularly merging branches into `master` ensures a cohesive and well-tested codebase for deployment, maintaining a structured and organized development workflow.
